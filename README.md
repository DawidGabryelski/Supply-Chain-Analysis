# Project: Analyzing Logistics Partner Performance


## Overview

The **Supply Chain** is the critical element ensuring well-functioning **logistics processes** across various industries. Every link in the chain—from the delivery of raw materials or components to the final customer—must **cooperate effectively** to provide the best possible products or services. 



This project focuses specifically on the performance of **Logistics Partners (Couriers)**, who are responsible for transporting goods between sequential representatives of the supply chain (e.g., suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers).

Based on the available dataset, we will leverage **SQL** to conduct a comprehensive analysis of courier companies, specifically evaluating their performance concerning **timeliness (On-Time Delivery)**, reliability, and exposure to **operational risk**. This analysis aims to identify high-performing and high-risk partners.

## Business Problem: Logistics Performance Management

Substandard service quality provided by logistics partners, often manifesting as frequent delivery delays, leads to disruptions in production planning, increased operational costs, and diminished customer satisfaction. Without an objective, data-driven evaluation, the company cannot accurately measure which partner delivers the most value and which constitutes a bottleneck within the supply chain.
